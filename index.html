            <h4>about me</h4>
            <p> I'm a native East Coaster, ex-Midwesterner, and current West Coaster. I'm a current student in the web development track at Bloc
                and I'm passionate about entering the field of web development. The prospect of 
                constantly learning new techniques, methods, and technologies for the 
                rest of my career is exciting - doing the same things over and over again is not my idea of
                a fulfilling career.
                <br>
                <br> 
                Outside of web development, 
                I enjoy spending my time helping others and spending as much time as possible outside. I strongly
                believe a rewarding life is built on experiences - I love visiting new places and discovering the
                unfamiliar things that life has to offer. 
                </p>

            <h4>experience</h4>
            <p>My most significant career experience to this point has been in the field of 9-1-1 Emergency Dispatch.
                I am able to quickly make decisions, 
                take control of situations, lead effectively, communicate with team members, and deal with a highly 
                stressful work environment. The job is essentially a continuous string of high-priority short-term 
                deadlines that have to be met. All of this is done while efficiently manipulating multiple software systems. 
                In addition, the people skills I have built through speaking with both citizens and public safety employees will 
                be valuable moving forward.
                <br>
                <br>
                Technically speaking - I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the jQuery library. I am
                continuing to learn new methods and languages daily - I am highly adaptable and I learn quickly. I believe
                I could be an asset on any web development team; reach out to me via my contact links below.

                <h3>public safety quiz</h3>
                <p id="publicsafety">This is a simple quiz application using HTML/CSS and JavaScript via jQuery. I use jQuery to manipulate the DOM in order to:
                    <br>- Cycle through questions 
                    <br>- Generate questions and answers
                    <br>- Produce feedback depending on correctness
                    <br>- Update/display the user's score and question number
                    <br>- Display final score with a prompt to retry the quiz
